# Data_Structures_and_Algorithms in Java :

Object - An object in Java is an actual instance of a class. While a class is just a blueprint, an object is the real thing created from it. For example, if Car is a class, then myCar is an object of that class. The object can store specific values (like color = "Red") and perform actions defined in the class (like drive). Objects allow us to use and manipulate real data based on the class structure.

Class - A class in Java is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines properties (variables) and behaviors (methods) that the objects will have. For example, a Car class might have a color and a method to drive. You use the class to create real-world objects (like a red car), and then interact with them using the class's defined structure. Classes help organize and reuse code in object-oriented programming.

Inheritance - Inheritance in Java is a feature that lets one class (called the child or subclass) use the properties and methods of another class (called the parent or superclass). It helps in reusing code and creating a relationship between classes. For example, if a class Animal has a method eat(), a class `Dog` can inherit from it and use eat() without writing it again. This makes programs easier to manage and extend.

Encapsulation - Encapsulation in Java means wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) together into a single unit — a class — and protecting that data from outside access. It is done by making variables private and providing public getter and setter methods to access or update them. For example, a BankAccount class can hide its balance and allow access only through methods like deposit() and getBalance(). This keeps the data safe and secure from unwanted changes.

Polymorphism - Polymorphism in Java means one thing behaving in different ways. It allows objects to respond differently to the same method call. There are two types: compile-time polymorphism(method overloading) and runtime polymorphism (method overriding). For example, a print() method might print text, numbers, or images depending on the input. Polymorphism makes code more flexible and easier to extend or modify.

Abstraction - Abstraction in Java means hiding unnecessary details and showing only the important parts of an object. It helps you focus on what an object does instead of how it does it. This is done using abstract classes or interfaces. For example, when you drive a car, you just use the steering and pedals—you don’t need to know how the engine works inside. Similarly, abstraction lets programmers use complex systems easily without dealing with all the inner code.

These are the 5 main concepts of OOPS :

1. Object –  A real-world entity
2. Class – Blueprint of collection of things 
3. Inheritance  – Reusing code from parent class
4. Encapsulation – Data protection and control
5. Polymorphism – One thing, many forms
6. Abstraction – Hiding complex details

OOPS means Object Oriented Programming system


Variable – A variable in Java is like a container that stores data. It has a name a type, and a value. For example, int age = 22; creates a variable named `age` that stores the number 22. Java is a statically-typed language, so you must declare the type (like int, String, or boolean) before using the variable. Variables help store and use data in a program as it runs.
